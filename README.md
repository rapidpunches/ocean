Hello! My work is free to use!
I appreciate being credited. It will help spread the use of marine life sprites when you do.
As I continue to make more assets, people will want to check back with me to get more :)

Thank you for supporting my work! I hope you enjoy!

If you need anything else, or if you just have marine life requests, feel free to contact me!

I'm still learning so bear with me. I don't know a lot of things (I only know about fish)!

Current creative goals:

* Making tiles (for water, sand, coral, and rock).
* Making new marine animal packs.
* Making a game in Pico-8
* Making a game in LOVE2D
* Making a game in TIC-80 (This is in-progress!)
* Learning GDScript?
* Making a game with GodotEngine
* Learning to animate with Blender2.8
* Make something with Twine?


Long term goals:

* A new mattress and bed frame.
* Getting a laptop that isn't heavy to carry that is capable of running the programs I use.

(I just want to be able to try these and see what people are making games with to better understand what's needed).
* Getting a Pico-8 license?
* Getting TexturePacker?
* Getting GameMaker Studio?
* Unity... is actually subscription-based so I don't want to use it but I may try the free version sometime.
* Crocotile3D
* What's https://assetforge.io/ ? I'll find out later.
